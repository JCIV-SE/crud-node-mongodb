# crud-node-mongodb
Learn &amp; build basic CRUD functionality using Node/Express and MongoDB/Mongoose.

## What you'll be doing

You'll be going through a relatively straightforward process of setting up a local (meaning on your local computer) Node server, setting up a local (meaning on your local computer) MongoDB database, and implementing basic CRUD routes between the two.

## Why you'll be doing this

CRUD functionality constitutes about 80% of all application functionality (some people say close to 100%, but lets stick to 80). That means that if we don't know how to implement CRUD functionality, or at least know what CRUD functionality looks like, we have a severe gap in our software engineering knowledge. We'll be going through these steps to fill this gap.

## How you'll be doing this

We're going to go through some basic setups for the technologies we'll be using, then we'll create the CRUD funcitonality.

[NODE] First things first, lets set up a local Node server:
1. Install Node on your computer

2. 


[MongoDB] Great, now lets set up a local mongoDB database:



[CRUD] Fantastic, and now for what we came for - CRUD:
